      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I study membranes for water desalination, more specifically the relationship between the synthesis
        of membranes to their structure and later to performance. <br><br>My dream since I was a child is to
        become a researcher in academy, I am fascinated by nature and my motivation is to find solutions to
        environmental problems inspired by nature while using sustainable products. <br><br>After completing my
        BSc from the Technion Summa Cum Laude in Environmental Engineering I continued for MSc studies
        in Environmental Chemistry at Weizmann, I studied the transport of pharmaceuticals in groundwater
        in Prof. Brian Berkowitz lab. <br><br>Upon finishing my MSc I wanted to gain practical industry experience
        before continuing in Academia, because I understood the importance of collaboration between
        Academia and industry. I was employed at Mekorot in Ashkelon as a desalination and water quality
        engineer. During my time at Mekorot I initiated different engineering projects, which won grants and
        awards such as: an Israel Innovation Authority Grant for treating brine effluents from inland
        desalination plants with wetlands- one of the first in the world. <br><br>My experience has emphasized
        the critical need to comprehend desalination membranes, with the goal of improving them
        and developing next generation sustainable materials for membrane fabrication. <br><br>Fully
        motivated, I started my PhD in polymeric membranes studies in Prof. Guy Ramon’s lab at
        the Technion. During my PhD I presented my research in 4 international conferences, won
        various academic awards, was a tutor in 3 academic courses, and established important
        collaborations with leading groups in the field of membranes. Among them is with Prof.
        Manish Kumar from the university of Texas-Austin who I worked with for 2 months afforded
        by BSF Rahamimoff travel grant. <br><br>For my Postdoc I plan to continue with cutting-edge
        research in Prof. Menachem Elimelech’s lab at Yale University, New Haven. Our plan is to
        shed light on the morphology-performance relationship in desalination membranes to
        improve their performance. <br><br>The prospect of learning from and being guided by a top-tier
        researcher like Prof. Elimelech, combined with the robust academic infrastructure and
        opportunities available in the US, drives my strong motivation to pursue research excellence
        in membrane science and environmental studies to design sustainable solutions for crucial
        environmental problems.</p>
